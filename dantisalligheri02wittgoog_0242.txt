· namely, tho discovery of a new MS. of
Dante's “De Vulgari Eloquentia.” When
Professor Pio RaJna prepared his critical

It appears that the aameMS‚ also contains

a hithero unrocorded text of Dante’a “ De

known Dantists will be interested to leam

whether this MS. contains the crucial roien·

critica hold to be a copyist’s interpolation.
